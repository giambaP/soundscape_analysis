 Dear Ilaria, Andrea and Manuele:
>>  Authors agree about categorizing the sources in a soundscape into  
>> biophony, geophony and anthrophony. Regarding the range of frequencies  
>> associated to the human-generated (anthrophony) sounds and those  
>> related to biological (biophony) ones, Bradfer‐Lawrence et al. [2019]  
>> say that there is "a theoretical frequency split between anthrophony  
>> (1–2 kHz) and biophony (2–11 kHz)". However, Kasten et al. [2012]  
>> consider a smaller frequency band for the biophony, namely from 2 to 8  
>> kHz.
>>  Geophony, in contrast, may occur in both of the above-mentioned  
>> frequency ranges; about that, Pijanowski et al. [2011] say that sounds  
>> of rain, wind and running water may cover frequencies from 0.1 to 1 kHz  
>> for little rain, but may go up "to 8 kHz for windy or moderate to heavy  
>> rain".
>>  According to that, my suggestion for a simple filtering would be  
>> removing the lowest and highest bands, such that features and the  
>> subsequent 1-NN classification is performed only for the biophony as  
>> defined by Kasten et al. [2012], i.e. for the rows of the spectrogram  
>> associated to the range from 2 to 8 kHz. Depending of the results,  
>> other bands might be considered if we are interested in distinguishing  
>> times and places in other terms (for instance, based on human-generated  
>> sounds).
